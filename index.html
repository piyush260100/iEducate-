                <p class="sectionsubtag">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
                    skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods include teaching,
                    training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the
                    guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal
                    or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or
                    acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
                    
                    Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                    school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is
                    compulsory up to a certain age.

                <p class="sectiontag">Why education is so important in our life?</p>
                <p class="sectionsubtag">Having education in an area helps people think, feel, and behave in a way that
                    contributes to their success, and improves not only their personal satisfaction but also their
                    community. In addition, education develops human personality, thoughts, dealing with others and prepares
                    people for life experiences.There are various benefits of having education such as having a good career,
                    having a good status in society, and having self-confidence. First of all, education gives us the chance
                of having a good career in our life. We can have plenty of chances to work at any workplace we wish. In
                other words, opportunities for a better employment can be more and easy. The highly educated we are the
                better chance we get. Moreover, education polishes our mind, reinforces our thoughts, and strengthens
                our character and behaviors toward others. It equips us with information in various fields in general
                and our specialization in particular; especially what we need to master in our job career. Therefore,
                without education we may not survive properly nor have a decent profession. Furthermore, education
                grants us a good status in society. As educated people, we are considered as a valuable source of
                knowledge for our society

                <p class="sectionsubtag">Education and poverty are inversely related. The higher the level of education of
                    the population, lesser will be the number of poor persons because education imparts knowledge and skills
                    which is supportive in higher wages. The direct effect of education on poverty reduction is through increasing
                    the earnings/income or wages. The indirect effect of education on poverty is important with respect to
                    ‘human poverty’ because as education improves the income, the fulfillment of basic necessities becomes easier
                    and raises the living standard which surely means the fall in human poverty.</p>
                    <p class="sectionsubtag">The notable thing regarding the education’s significant role in poverty reduction
                        is the direct linear relationship between education and earnings Colclough, Al-Samarrai, Rose, and Tembon (2003). In
                        Pakistan, it has been found that monthly earnings of an individual worker increased by 7.3 percent with an additional
                        year of schooling. Earnings will be increased by 37 percent with the attainment of ten years of
                        schooling against no education.</p>
